# BookRat_Flutter_App

This is a simple android mobile app in flutter.
If you were an avid reader and you lost the art of reading a full long book, then this app will help.
If you were an avid reader and you forgot most of the stuff that you read and you want to freshen it up. Then this app is for you.

## Getting Started
As per this commit, you will need to do some manual work on creating a json file for your book and add it in the lib/assets/books folder.
Please make sure that the json structure is compatible by referring to other books in the folder.
